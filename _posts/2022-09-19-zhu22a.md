abstract: Feature engineering, a crucial step of machine learning, aims to extract
  useful features from raw data to improve model performance. In recent years, great
  efforts have been devoted to Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE) to replace expensive
  human labor. However, all existing methods treat AutoFE as an optimization problem
  over a discrete feature space. Huge search space leads to significant computational
  overhead. Unlike previous work, we perform AutoFE in a continuous vector space and
  propose a differentiable method called DIFER in this paper. We first introduce a
  feature optimizer based on the encoder-predictor-decoder framework, which maps features
  into the continuous vector space via the encoder, optimizes the embedding along
  the gradient direction induced by the predictor, and recovers better features from
  the optimized embedding by the decoder. Based on the feature optimizer, we employ
  a feature evolution method to search for better features iteratively. Extensive
  experiments on classification and regression datasets demonstrate that DIFER can
  significantly outperform the state-of-the-art AutoFE methods in terms of both model
  performance and computational efficiency. The implementation of DIFER is avaialable
  on \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DIFER-3FBC/}.
