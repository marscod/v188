title: When, where, and how to add new neurons to ANNs
openreview: BNxx4WUzBl5
abstract: 'Neurogenesis in ANNs is an understudied and difficult problem, even compared
  to other forms of structural learning like pruning. By decomposing it into triggers
  and initializations, we introduce a framework for studying the various facets of
  neurogenesis: when, where, and how to add neurons during the learning process. We
  present the Neural Orthogonality (NORTH*) suite of neurogenesis strategies, combining
  layer-wise triggers and initializations based on the orthogonality of activations
  or weights to dynamically grow performant networks that converge to an efficient
  size. We evaluate our contributions against other recent neurogenesis works across
  a variety of supervised learning tasks.'
