title: Automatic Termination for Hyperparameter Optimization
openreview: rAflwNFGUxq
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely popular approach for the hyperparameter
  optimization (HPO) in machine learning.  At its core, BO iteratively evaluates promising
  configurations until a user-defined budget, such as wall-clock time or number of
  iterations, is exhausted. While the final performance after tuning heavily depends
  on the provided budget, it is hard to pre-specify an optimal value in advance. In
  this work, we propose an effective and intuitive termination criterion for BO that
  automatically stops  the procedure if it is sufficiently close to the global optimum.
  Our key insight is that the discrepancy between the true objective (predictive performance
  on test data) and the computable target (validation performance) suggests stopping
  once the suboptimality in optimizing the target is dominated by the statistical
  estimation error. Across an extensive range of real-world HPO problems and baselines,
  we show that our termination criterion achieves a better trade-off between the test
  performance and optimization time. Additionally, we find that overfitting may occur
  in the context of HPO, which is arguably an overlooked problem in the literature,
  and show how our termination criterion helps to mitigate this phenomenon on both
  small and large datasets.
