title: 'Opening the Black Box: Automated Software Analysis for Algorithm Selection'
openreview: Sgg5KAwNg9
abstract: Impressive performance improvements have been achieved in many areas of
  AI by meta-algorithmic techniques, such as automated algorithm selection and configuration.
  However, existing techniques treat the target algorithms they are applied to as
  black boxes â€“ nothing is known about their inner workings. This allows meta-algorithmic
  techniques to be used broadly, but leaves untapped potential performance improvements
  enabled by information gained from a deeper analysis of the target algorithms. In
  this paper, we open the black box without sacrificing universal applicability of
  meta-algorithmic techniques by automatically analyzing algorithms. We show how to
  use this information to perform algorithm selection, and demonstrate improved performance
  compared to previous approaches that treat algorithms as black boxes.
