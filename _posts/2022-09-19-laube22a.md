title: What to expect of hardware metric predictors in NAS
openreview: B__lCvzZglc
abstract: Modern Neural Architecture Search (NAS) focuses on finding the best performing
  architectures in hardware-aware settings; e.g., those with an optimal tradeoff of
  accuracy and latency. Due to many advantages of prediction models over live measurements,
  the search process is often guided by estimates of how well each considered network
  architecture performs on the desired metrics. Typical prediction models range from
  operation-wise lookup tables over gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, with
  little known information on how they compare. We evaluate 18 different performance
  predictors on ten combinations of metrics, devices, network types, and training
  tasks, and find that MLP models are the most promising. We then simulate and evaluate
  how the guidance of such prediction models affects the subsequent architecture selection.
  Due to inaccurate predictions, the selected architectures are generally suboptimal,
  which we quantify as an expected reduction in accuracy and hypervolume. We show
  that simply verifying the predictions of just the selected architectures can lead
  to substantially improved results. Under a time budget, we find it preferable to
  use a fast and inaccurate prediction model over accurate but slow live measurements.
