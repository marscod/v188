title: 'Syne Tune: A Library for Large Scale Hyperparameter Tuning and Reproducible
  Research'
openreview: rg-lnb6CQxq
abstract: 'We present Syne Tune, a library for large-scale distributed hyperparameter
  optimization (HPO). Syne Tuneâ€™s modular  architecture allows users to easily switch
  between different execution backends to facilitate experimentation and makes it
  easy to contribute new optimization algorithms. To foster reproducible benchmarking,
  Syne Tune provides an efficient simulator backend and a benchmarking suite, which
  are essential for large-scale evaluations of distributed asynchronous HPO algorithms
  on tabulated and surrogate benchmarks. We showcase these functionalities with a
  range of state-of-the-art gradient-free optimizers, including multi-fidelity and
  transfer learning approaches on popular benchmarks from the literature. Additionally,
  we demonstrate the benefits of Syne Tunefor constrained and multi-objective HPO
  applications through two use cases: the former considers hyperparameters that induce
  fair solutions and the latter automatically selects machine types along with the
  conventional hyperparameters.'
