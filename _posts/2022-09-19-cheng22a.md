title: 'ScaleNAS: Multi-Path One-Shot NAS for Scale-Aware High-Resolution Representation'
openreview: SBxeLI4nEe9
abstract: Scale variance among different sizes of body parts and objects is a challenging
  problem for visual recognition tasks. Existing works usually design dedicated backbone
  or apply Neural architecture Search (NAS) for each task to tackle this challenge.
  However, existing works impose significant limitations on the design or search space.
  To solve these problems, we present ScaleNAS, a one-shot learning method for exploring
  scale-aware representations. ScaleNAS solves multiple tasks at a time by searching
  multi-scale feature aggregation. ScaleNAS adopts a flexible search space that allows
  an arbitrary number of blocks and cross-scale feature fusions. To cope with the
  high search cost incurred by the flexible space, ScaleNAS employs one-shot learning
  for multi-scale supernet driven by grouped sampling and evolutionary search. Without
  further retraining, ScaleNet can be directly deployed for different visual recognition
  tasks with superior performance. We use ScaleNAS to create high-resolution models
  for two different tasks, ScaleNet-P for human pose estimation and ScaleNet-S for
  semantic segmentation. ScaleNet-P and ScaleNet-S outperform existing manually crafted
  and NAS-based methods in both tasks. When applying ScaleNet-P to bottom-up human
  pose estimation, it surpasses the state-of-the-art HigherHRNet. In particular, ScaleNet-P4
  achieves 71.6% AP on COCO test-dev, achieving new state-of-the-art result.
