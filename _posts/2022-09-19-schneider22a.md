title: Tackling Neural Architecture Search With Quality Diversity Optimization
openreview: BAzgqswmSx9
abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has been studied extensively and has grown
  to become a research field with substantial impact. While classical single-objective
  NAS searches for the architecture with the best performance, multi-objective NAS
  considers multiple objectives that should be optimized simultaneously, e.g., minimizing
  resource usage along the validation error. Although considerable progress has been
  made in the field of multi-objective NAS, we argue that there is some discrepancy
  between the actual optimization problem of practical interest and the optimization
  problem that multi-objective NAS tries to solve. We resolve this discrepancy by
  formulating the multi-objective NAS problem as a quality diversity optimization
  (QDO) problem and introduce three quality diversity NAS optimizers (two of them
  belonging to the group of multifidelity optimizers), which search for high-performing
  yet diverse architectures that are optimal for application-specific niches, e.g.,
  hardware constraints. By comparing these optimizers to their multi-objective counterparts,
  we demonstrate that quality diversity NAS in general outperforms multi-objective
  NAS with respect to quality of solutions and efficiency. We further show how applications
  and future NAS research can thrive on QDO.
