title: 'LassoBench: A High-Dimensional Hyperparameter Optimization Benchmark Suite
  for Lasso'
openreview: HU7eP2fR7lc
abstract: While Weighted Lasso sparse regression has appealing statistical guarantees
  that would entail a major real-world impact in finance, genomics, and brain imaging
  applications, it is typically scarcely adopted due to its complex high-dimensional
  space composed by thousands of hyperparameters. On the other hand, the latest progress
  with high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization (HD-HPO) methods for black-box
  functions demonstrates that high-dimensional applications can indeed be efficiently
  optimized. Despite this initial success, HD-HPO approaches are mostly applied to
  synthetic problems with a moderate number of dimensions, which limits its impact
  in scientific and engineering applications. We propose LassoBench, the first benchmark
  suite tailored for Weighted Lasso regression. LassoBench consists of benchmarks
  for both well-controlled synthetic setups (number of samples, noise level, ambient
  and effective dimensionalities, and multiple fidelities) and real-world datasets,
  which enables the use of many flavors of HPO algorithms to be studied and extended
  to the high-dimensional Lasso setting. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art HPO methods
  and 3 Lasso baselines, and demonstrate that Bayesian optimization and evolutionary
  strategies can improve over the methods commonly used for sparse regression while
  highlighting limitations of these frameworks in very high-dimensional and noisy
  settings.
