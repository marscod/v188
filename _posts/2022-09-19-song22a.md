title: 'Open Source Vizier: Distributed Infrastructure and API for Reliable and Flexible
  Blackbox Optimization'
openreview: rOOgZaMl7x9
software: https://github.com/google/vizier
abstract: Vizier is the de-facto blackbox optimization service across Google, having
  optimized some of Google’s largest products and research efforts. To operate at
  the scale of tuning thousands of users’ critical systems, Vizier solved key design
  challenges in providing multiple different features, while remaining fully fault-tolerant.
  In this paper, we introduce Open Source (OSS) Vizier, a Python-based interface for
  blackbox optimization and research, based on the Google-internal Vizier infrastructure
  and framework. OSS Vizier provides an API capable of defining and solving a wide
  variety of optimization problems, including multi-metric, early stopping, transfer
  learning, and conditional search. Furthermore, it is designed to be a distributed
  system that assures reliability, and allows multiple parallel evaluations of the
  user’s objective function. The flexible RPC-based infrastructure allows users to
  access OSS Vizier from binaries written in any language. OSS Vizier also provides
  a back-end (”Pythia”) API that gives algorithm authors a way to interface new algorithms
  with the core Vizier system. OSS Vizier is available at \url{https://github.com/google/vizier}.
