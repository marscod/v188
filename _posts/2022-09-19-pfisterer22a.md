title: YAHPO Gym - An Efficient Multi-Objective Multi-Fidelity Benchmark for Hyperparameter
  Optimization
openreview: H2zlL3EXBxq
software: https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo_gym
abstract: When developing and analyzing new hyperparameter optimization methods, it
  is vital to empirically evaluate and compare them on well-curated benchmark suites.
  In this work, we propose a new set of challenging and relevant benchmark problems
  motivated by desirable properties and requirements for such benchmarks. Our new
  surrogate-based benchmark collection consists of 14 scenarios that in total constitute
  over 700 multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization problems, which all enable multi-objective
  hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, we empirically compare surrogate-based
  benchmarks to the more widely-used tabular benchmarks, and demonstrate that the
  latter may produce unfaithful results regarding the performance ranking of HPO methods.
  We examine and compare our benchmark collection with respect to defined requirements
  and propose a single-objective as well as a multi-objective benchmark suite on which
  we compare 7 single-objective and 7 multi-objective optimizers in a benchmark experiment.  Our
  software is available at \url{https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo_gym}.
