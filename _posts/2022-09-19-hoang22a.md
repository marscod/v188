title: 'AutoCoG: A Unified Data-Model Co-Search Framework for Graph Neural Networks'
openreview: rU9xzLgFre5
abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has demonstrated success in discovering
  promising architectures for vision or language modeling tasks, and it has recently
  been introduced to searching for graph neural networks (GNNs) as well. Despite the
  preliminary success, GNNs struggle in dealing with heterophily or low-homophily
  graphs where connected nodes may have different class labels and dissimilar features.
  To this end, we propose co-optimizing both the input graph topology and the modelâ€™s
  architecture topology simultaneously. That yields AutoCoG, the first unified data-model
  co-search NAS framework for GNNs. By defining a highly flexible data-model co-search
  space, AutoCoG is gracefully formulated as a principled bi-level optimization that
  can be end-to-end solved by the differentiable search methods. Experiments show
  AutoCoG achieves gains of up to 4% for Actor, 7.3% on average for Web datasets,
  0.17% for CoAuthor-CS, and finally 5.4% for Wikipedia-Photo benchmarks. All codes
  will be released upon paper acceptance.
