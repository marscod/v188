title: A Tree-Structured Multi-Task Model Recommender
openreview: SrrgrWs0-g5
software: https://github.com/zhanglijun95/TreeMTL
abstract: Tree-structured multi-task architectures have been employed to jointly tackle
  multiple vision tasks in the context of multi-task learning (MTL).  The major challenge
  is to determine where to branch out for each task given a backbone model to optimize
  for both task accuracy and computation efficiency. To address the challenge, this
  paper proposes a recommender that, given a set of tasks and a convolutional neural
  network-based backbone model, automatically suggests tree-structured multi-task
  architectures that could achieve a high task performance while meeting a user-specified
  computation budget without performing model training. Extensive evaluations on popular
  MTL benchmarks show that the recommended architectures could achieve competitive
  task accuracy and computation efficiency compared with state-of-the-art MTL methods.
  Our tree-structured multi-task model recommender is open-sourced and available at
