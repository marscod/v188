title: Bayesian Generational Population-Based Training
openreview: rx-efyxBSg9
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential for training generally
  capable agents that can interact autonomously in the real world. However, one key
  limitation is the brittleness of RL algorithms to core hyperparameters and network
  architecture choice. Furthermore, non-stationarities such as evolving training data
  and increased agent complexity mean that different hyperparameters and architectures
  may be optimal at different points of training. This motivates AutoRL, a class of
  methods seeking to automate these design choices. One prominent class of AutoRL
  methods is Population-Based Training (PBT), which have led to impressive performance
  in several large scale settings. In this paper, we introduce two new innovations
  in PBT-style methods. First, we employ trust-region based Bayesian Optimization,
  enabling full coverage of the high-dimensional mixed hyperparameter search space.
  Second, we show that using a generational approach, we can also learn both architectures
  and hyperparameters jointly on-the-fly in a single training run. Leveraging the
  new highly parallelizable Brax physics engine, we show that these innovations lead
  to dramatic performance gains, significantly outperforming the tuned baseline while
  learning entire configurations on the fly.
